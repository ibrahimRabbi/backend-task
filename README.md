# Node Express TypeScript Project

This is a Node.js and Express project written in TypeScript. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (installed globally, optional)

   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Compile TypeScript files**:
   Run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode to compile `.ts` files to `.js`:
   ```bash
   tsc -w
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   In a new terminal window, run the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev (command run from script)
   ```

3. Open your browser or API client (e.g., Postman) and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Available Scripts

Here are the commonly used scripts for this project:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with auto-reload.
- `tsc -w`: Watches and compiles TypeScript files on changes.
- `npm start`: Starts the server in production mode.
